URemote is a very simple cross-platform remote control lib I wrote because every time I needed a remote I had to rewrite the whole thing

The client sends simple UDP packets that contain a number of fields:
0xXX - first byte = packet signature
and then fields like this:
0xTT - first byte = tag ID
0xSS - length of data (can be 1 or 2 bytes wide or it can even be missing (see lengthForTag in the server and use setKnownLength in the client)
0xSS bytes of data - the actual payload of the field

or, you can add a "description" at the beginning of the packet (or even an empty one if you already know the order) (after the signature) that tells the server in which order and what fields follow, so 0xTT is no longer needed (see tagsForDescription on the server side and the description parameter to endPacket() on the client side)

it's useful for simple tasks like sending accelerometer and button data to an emulator or to the iOS Simulator
